# Handwriting Sentiment Classifier

Handwriting-Sentiment-Classifier captures handwriting data (speed, pressure, azimuth, and altitude from a web canvas and uses machine learning (Random Forest) to predict the writers's emotion. The data is captured using a drawing interfaxe and processed on the backend for predictions.

### Project Overview:
Handwriting can reveal crucial insights into an individual's motor skills and emotional state. This data explores handwriting features to assess a child's Fine Motor Skills (FMS) and emotions while writing. This data collection encompasses two distinct handwriting tasks: sentence bolding and word copying. Three psychologists use these tasks to observe children's expressions and movements, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their emotional responses and FMS proficiency during the writing process. The resulting handwriting dataset comprises seven variables and three target data collected from 98 elementary students aged 6 to 9.

### Limitations:
The limited number of respondents in the Handwriting Features dataset is a significant concern, as data collection was conducted in only three locations within one district. Consequently, the dataset may not adequately represent a broader range of students from different areas. It's important to acknowledge that specific local or unique factors present in those locations may not fully capture the diversity that exists on a larger scale.

### Ethical Considerations:
The research prioritized careful and ethical conduct throughout the study. Approval was obtained from the National and Political Unity Agency and the Education Office of Jember Regency, confirming adherence to established research ethics guidelines. Ethical clearance was also granted by the Institutional Review Board of the education authorities.
