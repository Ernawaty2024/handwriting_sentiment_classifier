# Handwriting Sentiment Classifier

## Overview
Handwriting-Sentiment-Classifier is a Flask web app that collects handwriting samples and uses a trained machine learning model to predict sentiment (positive or negative). Features such as writing speed, pressure, and stroke angles are analyzed to classify the emotion behind the handwriting.

### Datasets Collection:
Handwriting can reveal crucial insights into an individual's motor skills and emotional state. This data explores handwriting features to assess a child's Fine Motor Skills (FMS) and emotions while writing. This data collection encompasses two distinct handwriting tasks: sentence bolding and word copying. Three psychologists use these tasks to observe children's expressions and movements, enabling a comprehensive analysis of their emotional responses and FMS proficiency during the writing process. The resulting handwriting dataset comprises seven variables and three target data collected from 98 elementary students aged 6 to 9.

### Data Analysis:
* Number of stroke
* Pressure
* Altitude
* Azimuth
* Label emotion
* Fine Motor Skills (FMS)

### Visualizations:



### Limitations:
The limitation in the number of respondents in the Handwriting Features dataset becomes increasingly significant becuse data collection was only carried out at three locations in one district. Thus, the representativeness of this dataset over a wider variety of students from locations may be limited. It is essential to recognize that particular local or unique phenomena present at that location cannot fully reflect the diversity that may occur on a larger scale.

### Ethical Considerations:
In our research, we prioritized careful and ethical conduct throughout the study. This research aligns with approvals from the National and Political Unity Agency and the Education Office of the Jember Regency, confirming adherence to established research ethics guidelines. The study received ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board at education authorities.
